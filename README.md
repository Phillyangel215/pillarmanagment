## 🎯 Phase 1: Foundation Setup ✅

- ✅ Clean Vite + React + TypeScript project structure
- ✅ Enterprise ESLint configuration with security rules
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode with path aliases (@/*)
- ✅ Enterprise design system with HIPAA compliance indicators
- ✅ Error boundary implementation
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Comprehensive build and quality checks

## 🔧 Enterprise Configurations

### TypeScript
- Strict mode enabled with comprehensive type checking
- Path aliases configured for clean imports
- No implicit any types allowed

### ESLint
- Enterprise-grade rules with security checks
- Accessibility (a11y) validation
- React and TypeScript best practices
